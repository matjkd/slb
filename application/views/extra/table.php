<h1>How does it work</h1>

<h2>Asset Finance</h2>

<p>Asset
finance is less straight forward than Factoring and Invoice Discounting due to
the wide range of assets that can be financed, and can offer an alternative to
a bank overdraft or loan. </p>



<p><strong>Asset
finance is available to a wide range of businesses to fund assets such as:</strong></p>









<ul><li>Vehicles</li><li>Machinery</li><li>A diverse
range of equipment</li><li>Stock</li></ul>



<p>Asset
finance works by the customer sourcing the product and negotiating the purchase
price.&#160; Upon doing so they will then file
a report to the Asset Finance company who will then in turn arrange for an
appropriate finance package.</p>



<p>Existing
company assets can also be financed providing that they have the appropriate
amount of equity, which can then be released to help fund the business - a
process known as sale and lease back.</p>



<p><strong>SLB</strong> will
consult with business owners to find the right solution and before potential
finance firms are recommended, we will work with their credit control
departments to ensure they are ready to be audited and have the necessary
requirements in place to qualify for the best possible rate from the lenders.</p>



<p>After this
process has been completed, <strong>SLB</strong> will work independently alongside your business
to ensure that you receive the right deal with the funder and just as importantly,
on the right terms.</p>



<p>If you or your
business is currently using Factoring and/or Invoice Discounting, <strong>SLB</strong> can still
assist by reviewing your existing deal with a fresh pair of eyes. It is quite
often the case that if a company uses invoice
finance, they do not regularly research the latest deals available to them or
reconcile this to their existing facility. </p><p><strong>Upon instructing <strong>SLB</strong> we shall:</strong></p><ul><li>Provide an update on invoice discounting and what is currently available on the market</li><li>Investigate your current facility and how much you are spending</li><li>Provide a comparison of the existing facility with what is presently available</li><li>Arrange for you to have a meeting with an experienced professional to discuss what might be the best facility for your business</li><li>Assist through to completion of a new facility or renegotiate terms with your current supplier</li></ul>
